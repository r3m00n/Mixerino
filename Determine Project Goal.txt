## The App will be used to search for Cocktail Recipies. People can get random or filter for specific cocktails.

## My motivation for this project is to have something to show off: Both to my friends and future employees.

## Users will have the opportunity to see a random cocktail and its ingredients. In the future I will implemet a feature where the user can filter the Cocktail by ingredient like the ones he currently has at home.
